# Tony's Dotfiles

My dotfiles and config files for Mac OSX. 

Directories are itterated and files with .symlink are symlinked into the proper location, and have the `.` added. For example:

    ~/dotfiles/zsh/zsh_profile.symlink => ~/.zsh_profile
    ~/dotfiles/git/gitconfig.symlink => ~/.gitconfig
    ...and so on

## Installing
- Clone repository (I recommend `~/dotfiles`). If you don't use `~/dotfiles`, you'll have to update a couple of the scripts to point them to the right place.
- `cd ~/dotfiles`
- `make`

### homebrew
- Add line to `Brewfile`
- Run `make brew`

### applications
- Apps are installed using [brew cask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask)
- To add an application add it to the `Brewfile`

Applications installed via App Store:
- 1Password
- Transmit
- TweetDeck

### node & npm
- Node is installed and managed using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
- Packages are managed in `scripts/npm_bundles.rb`.
- Add a new package, and run `make node`.

### osx defaults
- Amend defaults as required in `scipts/.osx`
- Run `make osx`

## Updating
You can run `make` at any time to keep things nice and tidy.
